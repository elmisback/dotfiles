* vim sessions
* zsh theming (esp. perhaps time-specific/an $ATMOSPHERE variable hooked to the desktop as well?)
* system-specific modifications (work vs. play, etc.--$ATMOSPHERE?)
* streamline ssh config?
* repair standard vim

# Ideas
* Hold command line at the bottom of the screen.

# Future
* try switching to dtach + dvtm
