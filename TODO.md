* vim sessions
* make nvim git's difftool
* zsh theming (esp. perhaps time-specific/an $ATMOSPHERE variable hooked to the desktop as well?)
* system-specific modifications (work vs. play, etc.--$ATMOSPHERE?)
* streamline ssh config?
* fix vim fold coloring
* repair standard vim
* work out MYVIMRC/VIMINIT variables as per https://tlvince.com/vim-respect-xdg

# Ideas
* Hold command line at the bottom of the screen.

# Future
